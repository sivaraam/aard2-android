    in an active dictionary and opens corresponding articles.
    User may optionally limit random lookup to only use favorite
    dictionaries.

    When viewing articles, volume up/down buttons scroll article
    content or, if at the bottom (top) of the page, move to the next
    (previous) article. Long press scrolls all the way to the bottom
    (top). In main view volume buttons cycle through tabs.

*** Fullscreen Mode
    On Android 4.4 and newer articles can be viewed in fullscreen
    mode. Pull down the top edge to exit fullscreen mode.

** Requested Permissions
*** android.permission.INTERNET
    The application uses the local embedded web server to provide article 
    content. This permission is necessary to run the server.

*** android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
    User chooses when to allow loading remote content: always,
    when on Wi-Fi or never. This permission is necessary to implement
    this.

** Launching from Other Applications

   Aard 2 lookup can be initiated from other applications, either
   through standard /Share/ action or directly, if application
   implemented an action to start Aard 2 with lookup intent.

   Applications can launch Aard 2 lookup by starting activity with intent
   ~aard2.lookup~ with text to look up passed as an extra string
    parameter [[http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/SearchManager.html#QUERY][SearchManager.QUERY]]. For example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC java
   Intent intent = new Intent("aard2.lookup");
   intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
   intent.putExtra(SearchManager.QUERY, "Foo Bar");
   startActivity(intent);
   #+END_SRC

   Same thing from a command line using /adb/:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   adb shell am start -a aard2.lookup -f 335544320 -e query "Foo Bar"
   #+END_SRC
